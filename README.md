Folders:

Data - input data (training and testing) - not pushed to git, because the files are too large
Models - NN models; not pushed, too large

VAE - variational autoencoders for 50 x 50 and 100 x 100 images
AE - autoencoders for 50 x 50 and 100 x 100 images

All images have 2 types of rocks: background and channel; binary images (1 and 0)
For example, a training instance can be 50 x 50 x 1
